# Benry & Krimpst

![Benry & Krimpst](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzE3NDE0MDU3LnBuZw==/315x250%23c/%2FyL5eG.png)

A classic setup, you see. A big guy and a smol guy. They are two brothers. One is a cripple, however. Use this to your advantage somehow.

## PLOT?: YES!!!

Benry and his brother Krimpst were enjoying a nice vacation, when it was suddenly interrupted by Cheif Jiminy!

*"Benry! Krimpst! We have a code tan! I need you to stop your vacation at once to jump to the nearest habitable planet, and set up a new colony, so the human race can reign once longer!"*

Benry and Krimpst are very visibly annoyed, especially Krimpst.

*"Got dang it, Jiminy! Always when I'm on vacation!"*

Benry tries to calm him. *"Krimpst, he didn’t want the earth to be destroyed just as much as we don’t want to save it! Cut him some slack, why don'tcha?"*

Jiminy continued, *"You know I love you boys, but by GAWD if you don’t do something, the human race will die with you! Go to the convenience store and buy a port-o-colony! Make your soon-to-be ancestors proud!"*

Benry & Krimpst both nod in agreement. They know what they have to do.

Now, is any of this exposition actually in the game? No. It's not. Luke was too lazy. Every bad thing that's ever happened to me was Luke's fault. But fear not! Because it's right here! On this website that looks like a sheet of paper.
