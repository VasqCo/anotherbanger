<span class="wave">Hello</span> <span class="wave">there!</span>

I wanted to set up this blog so that Luke and I have ways to show off progress with our game or music in a way that wasn't as limiting as Twitter or another similar platform. I'm the sherrif here, I'm in control! I can do whatever <span class="shake">crazy</span> shit I want! I can even say cis! You can't say cis on Twitter.

Here, I can put images wherever,

<img src="https://cdn.cdnstep.com/mpQOgzhBAYucRFYrqKH3/14.webp" alt="nyancat" width="144" />

or videos wherever!

![sickvideo]({{ "/videos/sickvideo.mp4" | relative_url }})

Truly, I have unlimted power.

I can't promise I'll post super often but you can [subscribe to our RSS feed]({{ "/feed.xml" | relative_url }}) and you'll be notified if we ever post anything. I'll also probably post on social media if we post anything. Anyway bye.
