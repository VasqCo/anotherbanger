# LukePNG

![Lukepng profile picture]({{ '/luke.png' | relative_url }}){: #luke-profile style="width:180px;"}

Hello! I am LUKEPNG!!! I'm credited as a programmer for all of our games but I actually never learned how to do that. I pay Matt to credit me as such as to be included. I also don't know how to write stories or write music either. I also pay him to credit me for some of his music. As to be included. Also my voice in all of my music is AI enhanced. My real singing voice is garbage and terrible. ðŸŽ‰

I also wasn't potty trained until a few days ago.

## Games

- ***Threshold*** â€” I'm credited as the sole programmer for our upcoming game Threshold, but in reality it's all Matt. Idk how to do shi.
- ***Benry & Krimspt*** â€” I didn't do notin'
- ***All other projects*** â€” Nothing

## Music

- Nothing......

## In conclusion.

I am a stupid lazy guy who has no talent or anything even, and couldn't even write my own bio page!! That's right, Matt wrote this whole thing!!!

...It's still all true though.
