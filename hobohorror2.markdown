# HOBO HORROR 2

Have you ever seen a homeless person on the side of the road and thought to yourself any of the following?:

1. Gosh dang! That thing is SCARY!
2. Gosh dang! I want to DESTROY that thing!

Then you'll probably hate this game, because they scare you and you can't kill them.

## PLOT?: <span style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-weight:700;">*barely*</span>

You are a contractor for a company called... god we made this game so long ago I don't remember. Anyway, your job is to... crank a generator in a sewer... and also close the sewer drain for some reason... and... fix an elevator... Dude wtf were you hired for?
